title: Apple's custom GPU, Imagination, and why no one should've been surprised

Apparently Imagination lost 60% of its stock value after it was revealed that Apple wouldn't be shipping its PowerVR GPUs within two years.

60%. Do you know what that means? It means many people were surprised. But why? If people had kept their heads to the ground they'd have noticed long ago.

Apple was always about vertical integration. The custom CPUs were already a big sign. And back in October 2016, the incredible David Kanter already published an article about [A Look Inside Apple's custom GPU for the iPhone](http://www.realworldtech.com/apple-custom-gpu/).

You know what this also means?

Someone had shorted their Imagination stock.
